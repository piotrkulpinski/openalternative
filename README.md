## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of the project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Airtable

The project is built on top of [Airtable](https://airtable.com) database. This allows me to quickly make changes and make use of the vast amount of extensions that Airtable has to offer.

In order to build your own version of this project, you will need to create your own Airtable base and fill in the environment variables with the appropriate values.

Easiest way to start is to duplicate the base I have created:

```

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
