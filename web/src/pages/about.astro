    <h2>Hi, Piotr here ðŸ‘‹</h2>

    <p>
      I was collecting nice open-source companies for quite some time now. Mostly to take some
      inspiration and learn from their code.
    </p>

    <p>
      Last week, I though it would be fun to learn this Astro thing everyone's talking about. So I
      thought building a directory website out of this collection was pretty good idea.
    </p>

    <p>
      After 2 days of building, OpenAlternative was born. It's a community driven list of open
      source alternatives to proprietary software and applications.
    </p>

    <p>Enjoy and feel free to contribute!</p>

    <h2>Tools Used</h2>
    <h3>Frontend</h3>
    <p>
      For the frontend, I used <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro</a>. It's a new
      static site generator that's really fast and fun to work with. Working with Astro feels like
      working with a modern framework like React or Vue, but it's actually a static site generator.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great addition to Astro is the ViewTransitions API support. It's a really cool feature that
      allows you to add page transitions to your website with just a few lines of code.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also used <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a> for styling. It's
      a utility-first CSS framework that's really easy to use and makes building websites a breeze.
    </p>

    <h3>Backend</h3>
    <p>
      For the database, I used <a href="https://airtable.com" target="_blank">Airtable</a>. It's a
      really cool tool that allows you to create databases with a really nice UI. It also has a
      really nice API that makes it easy to work with.
    </p>

    <p>
      Screenshots are generated automatically with <a
        href="https://screenshotone.com"
        target="_blank"
        title="Screenshot API">ScreenshotOne</a
      >. Highly recommended service for generating screenshots of websites.
    </p>

    <h2>Contribute</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any suggestions for open source alternatives to proprietary software and
      applications, feel free to contribute to the list. You can also contribute by adding new
      categories or improving the website. The source code is available on <a
        href="https://github.com/piotrkulpinski/openalternative"
        target="_blank">GitHub</a
      >.
