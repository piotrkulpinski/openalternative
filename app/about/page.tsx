        <h2>Hi, Piotr here ðŸ‘‹</h2>

        <p>
          I was collecting nice open-source companies for quite some time now. Mostly to take some
          inspiration and learn from their code.
        </p>

        <p>
          Last week, I though it would be fun to learn this Astro thing everyone&apos;s talking
          about. So I thought building a directory website out of this collection was pretty good
          idea.
        </p>

        <p>
          After 2 days of building, OpenAlternative was born. It&apos;s a community driven list of
          open source alternatives to proprietary software and applications.
        </p>

        <p>Enjoy and feel free to contribute!</p>

        <h2>Tools Used</h2>
        <h3>Frontend</h3>
        <p>
          For the frontend, I initially used{" "}
          <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">
            Astro
          </a>
          . It&apos;s a new static site generator that&apos;s really fast and fun to work with.
          Working with Astro feels like working with a modern framework like React or Vue, but
          it&apos;s actually a static site generator.
        </p>
        <p>
          A great addition to Astro is the ViewTransitions API support. It&apos;s a really cool
          feature that allows you to add page transitions to your website with just a few lines of
          code.
        </p>
        <p>After a while, I switched to Next.js for better SEO and performance.</p>

        <p>
          I also used{" "}
          <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">
            Tailwind CSS
          </a>{" "}
          for styling. It&apos;s a utility-first CSS framework that&apos;s really easy to use and
          makes building websites a breeze.
        </p>

        <h3>Backend</h3>
        <p>
          For the database, I used{" "}
          <a href="https://airtable.com" target="_blank">
            Airtable
          </a>
          . It&apos;s a really cool tool that allows you to create databases with a really nice UI.
          It also has a really nice API that makes it easy to work with.
        </p>

        <p>
          Screenshots are generated automatically with{" "}
          <a href="https://screenshotone.com" target="_blank" title="Screenshot API">
            ScreenshotOne
          </a>
          . Highly recommended service for generating screenshots of websites.
        </p>
