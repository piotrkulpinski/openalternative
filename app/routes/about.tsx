        <h2>Hi, Piotr here ðŸ‘‹</h2>

        <p>
          I was collecting nice open-source companies for quite some time now. Mostly to take some
          inspiration and learn from their code.
        </p>

        <p>
          Last week, I though it would be fun to learn this Astro thing everyoneâ€™s talking about. So
          I thought building a directory website out of this collection was pretty good idea.
        </p>

        <p>
          After 2 days of building, OpenAlternative was born. Itâ€™s a community driven list of open
          source alternatives to proprietary software and applications.
        </p>

        <p>Enjoy and feel free to contribute!</p>

        <h2>Tools Used</h2>
        <h3>Frontend</h3>
        <p>
          For the frontend, I used{" "}
          <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            Astro
          </a>
          . Itâ€™s a new static site generator thatâ€™s really fast and fun to work with. Working with
          Astro feels like working with a modern framework like React or Vue, but itâ€™s actually a
          static site generator.
        </p>
        <p>
          A great addition to Astro is the ViewTransitions API support. Itâ€™s a really cool feature
          that allows you to add page transitions to your website with just a few lines of code.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also used{" "}
          <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            Tailwind CSS
          </a>{" "}
          for styling. Itâ€™s a utility-first CSS framework thatâ€™s really easy to use and makes
          building websites a breeze.
        </p>

        <h3>Backend</h3>
        <p>
          For the database, I used{" "}
          <a href="https://kulp.in/airtable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            Airtable
          </a>
          . Itâ€™s a really cool tool that allows you to create databases with a really nice UI. It
          also has a really nice API that makes it easy to work with.
        </p>

        <p>
          Screenshots are generated automatically with{" "}
          <a
            href="https://kulp.in/screenshotone"
            target="_blank"
            title="Screenshot API"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            ScreenshotOne
          </a>
          . Highly recommended service for generating screenshots of websites.
        </p>
