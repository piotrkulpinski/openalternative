            OpenAlternative
          </a>{" "}
          –s a community driven list of open source alternatives to proprietary software and
          applications. The goal of the site is to be your first stop when researching for a new
          open source service to help you grow your business. It will help you find alternatives and
          reviews of the products you already use.
        </p>

        <h2>How did OpenAlternative get started?</h2>

        <p>
          The project started as a weekend project to learn a new technology and try something new
          and fun from scratch. It gained a lot of traction early on (
          <a href="https://kulp.in/launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">

          –n one week,{" "}

          ) so it was clear that there was a need for a site like this.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve always been a fan of open source software and I’ve always wanted to contribute to the
          community in some way. I thought that creating a list of open source alternatives to
          proprietary software and applications would be a great way to give back to the community.
